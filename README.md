# BEST PRACTICES TO FOLLOW WHILE CREATING COMPONENTS
- Use Camelcasing for component Name. e.g., Chai.jsx, App.jsx, Component.jsx, etc.
- Can return only one element from the component function, so use fragments for that <></>. 
Although you can also use a div
- While naming the file use camelcase in that also but it is not necessary always.
- component name extension should be .jsx (because some libraries made it mandatory)
- In the end, if a component/function is returning HTML then it should be named with the extension .jsx, and if it is not returning any HTML then it can be named with the extension .js
